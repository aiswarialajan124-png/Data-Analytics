# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a retail superstore to understand sales trends, regional performance, product categories, and customer behaviour.
The goal is to extract meaningful business insights using Python and data analysis techniques.

This project is part of a larger **Data Analytics Portfolio** created to demonstrates practical, job-ready analytics skills.

## Dataset

- File: 'Sample Superstore Practice.xlsx'
- Records Include:
    - Order and shipping dates.
    - Customer and regional information.
    - Product categories and sub-categories.
    - Sales, profit, discount, and quantity.

## Data Cleaning
The following data preparation steps were performed:
- Removed unnecessary unnamed columns from the dataset.
- Converted order dates to datetime format.
- Checked and handled missing values where necessary.

These steps ensure the accuracy and reliabilty of the analysis.
