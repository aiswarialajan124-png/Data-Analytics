# Healthcare COVID-19 Analysis
The project analyzes patient-level COVID-19 healthcare data to identify factors associated with severe outcomes,including ICU admission and death.The analysis focuses on demographic characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions to support data-driven healthcare insights.

## Dataset
- File: 'Covid Data.csv'
- Type: Patient-level COVID-19 healthcare dataset
- Key Fields:
   - Age
   - ICU admission
   - Comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension,obesity, etc.)
   - COVID test classification
   - Death outcome

## Tools
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Feature engineering (death indicator)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Healthcare risk factor analysis
-Visual storytelling of patient outcomes

## Key Insights
- Older patients exhibit significantly higher mortality risk.
- ICU admission is strongly associated with higher death rates.
- Pre-existing conditions such as diabetes,hypertension,obesity,and chronic kidney disease increase mortality risk.
- COVID-positive patients experience substantiallu higher death rates compared to non-COVID cases.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how healthcare data can be analyzed to identify high risk patient groups during a pandemic.The insights can support resource allocation, early intervention strategies, and pubic health decision-making.
